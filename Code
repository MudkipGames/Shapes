I don't know what "abstract" is however I do see that it is a class.

Class = Shape

// set variables for the Shape class

public surfaceArea(): float

public volume(): float

public render(): float

Class = Cuboid

// set variables for the Cuboid class

private width: float = 0.0;

private height: float = 0.0;

private depth: float = 0.0;

// set getters and setters

public getWidth(): float

private setWidth(width: float)

public getHeight(): float

private setHeight(height: float)

public getDepth(): float

private setDepth(depth: float)

// return the class as a usable variable

public Cuboid(width: float, height: float, depth: float)

Class = Cylinder

// set variables for Cylinder class

private radius: float = 0.0;

private height: float = 0.0;

// set getters and setters

public getRadius(): float

private setRadius(radius: float)

public getHeight(): float

private setHeight(height: float)

// return the class as a usable variable

public Cylinder(radius: float, height: float)

Class = Sphere

// set variables for the class

private radius: float = 0.0;

// set getters and setters

public getRadius(): float

private setRadius(radius: float)

// return the class as a usable variable

public Sphere(radius: float)

// Make a class for testing

Class = ShapesTest

public main()
